# Inverse Kinematics - Fabrik Algorithm

Hello! Welcome to my page. I've implemented the fabrik algorithm in javascript as seen from this paper: http://www.andreasaristidou.com/publications/CUEDF-INFENG,%20TR-632.pdf

I've incorporated the fabrik algorithm into a UI using [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [react-konva](https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva) for the canvas
shapes, and [ant-design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) for the ui components to create a rich & interactive canvas demo.

Interactivity includes:

* Being able to manipulate Sliders
* Change individual length of different bones
* Changing # of Bones in the Chain
